      <h3>CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE FIRST AVENGER</h3>
      <p>It is 1941 and the world is in the throes of war. Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) wants to do his part and join America's
      armed forces, but the military rejects him because of his small stature. Finally, Steve gets his chance when he is
      accepted into an experimental program that turns him into a supersoldier called Captain America. Joining forces with
      Bucky Barnes (Sebastian Stan) and Peggy Carter (Hayley Atwell), Captain America leads the fight against the Nazi-backed
      HYDRA organization.</p>

      <h3>CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER</h3>
      <p>After the cataclysmic events in New York with his fellow Avengers, Steve Rogers, aka Captain America (Chris Evans),
      lives in the nation's capital as he tries to adjust to modern times. An attack on a S.H.I.E.L.D. colleague throws Rogers
      into a web of intrigue that places the whole world at risk. Joining forces with the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and
      a new ally, the Falcon, Rogers struggles to expose an ever-widening conspiracy, but he and his team soon come up against

      <h3>CAPTAIN AMERICA: CIVIL WAR</h3>
      <p>Political pressure mounts to install a system of accountability when the actions of the Avengers lead to collateral
      damage. The new status quo deeply divides members of the team. Captain America (Chris Evans) believes superheroes should
      remain free to defend humanity without government interference. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) sharply disagrees and
      supports oversight. As the debate escalates into an all-out feud, Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy
      Renner) must pick a side.</p>
